# Sorting2
This project is an assignment in my college.

You're allowed to take this source code if you feel overwhelmed after you try to solve the problem by your hand. But, if you haven't try to solve that problem, I recommended you solve it first, even with a silly solution.

If there is any question about my solution, don't hesitate to ask me in the **Discussion**.
